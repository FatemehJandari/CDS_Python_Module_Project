# Coding For Data Science, Python module final project: Unsupervised Clustering
In this course project, The "P6: I mammiferi depongono uova?" dataset is used to train an unsupervised k-means model.
Three different approaches for dimentionality reduction:
1. Original (no dimentionality reduction)
2. With Principal compenent analysis (PCA)
3. With Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
